  <p>JavaScript is a scripting language used to create dynamic and interactive web content.</p>
     JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/ ⓘ), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Ninety-nine percent of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.[10]
     Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.
